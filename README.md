<h1>SimpleApiTemplate README</h1>
<h3>### Project Under Development</h3>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>SimpleApiTemplate is a streamlined, efficient solution designed to accelerate the development process of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in web applications. Utilizing the power of Entity Framework Core, this project simplifies data handling by implementing generic controllers and repositories. It's tailored for developers looking to minimize boilerplate code while maintaining flexibility and scalability in their projects.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Generic Controllers and Repositories</strong>: Facilitate rapid development of CRUD operations across different entities without the need to write repetitive code.</li>
   <li><strong>Entity Framework Core Integration</strong>: Leverages EF Core for ORM capabilities, ensuring efficient data access and manipulation.</li>
   <li><strong>Swagger/OpenAPI Support</strong>: Automatically generates API documentation, making it easier to understand and test the API endpoints.</li>
   <li><strong>Secure API Endpoints</strong>: Implements security measures including an API key scheme for authentication.</li>
   <li><strong>PostgreSQL Database Support</strong>: Configured to use PostgreSQL, providing a robust and scalable database solution.</li>
   <li><strong>AutoMapper Integration</strong>: Simplifies the task of transforming data between types, enhancing code maintainability and readability.</li>
   <li><strong>Identity Framework Integration</strong>: Supports user authentication and authorization, making it suitable for applications requiring user management.</li>
   <li><strong>Email Services.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
   <li>.NET 8.0.1 SDK</li>
   <li>PostgreSQL Server</li>
   <li>Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, or another compatible IDE</li>
</ul>
<h4>Setting Up</h4>
<ol>
   <li><strong>Clone the repository</strong> to your local machine.</li>
   <li><strong>Install PostgreSQL</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Update the connection string</strong> in <code>appsettings.json</code> with your PostgreSQL server details.</li>
   <li><strong>Run database migrations</strong> if necessary to set up your database schema.</li>
   <li><strong>Build and run the project</strong> using your IDE or the .NET CLI.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Using the API</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Access the Swagger UI by navigating to <code>https://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/swagger</code> in your web browser. This interface allows you to test and explore the available API endpoints.</li>
   <li>Use the provided endpoints to perform CRUD operations on your entities. The generic controller supports operations like <code>GetAll</code>, <code>Get/{id}</code>, <code>Create</code>, <code>Update/{id}</code>, and <code>Delete/{id}</code>.</li>
  <li>If you need to update any repository method or controller action, just override it. Or create a new method or action.</li>
  <li>Every new entity needs to inherit from BaseEntity, and its controller must inherit from GenericController, just as its repository must inherit from GenericRepository.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>This project is structured around the following key components:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Data Context</strong>: Serves as the bridge between the application and the database, configured to use PostgreSQL.</li>
   <li><strong>Models</strong>: Represent database models, inheriting from a base entity class with a primary key.</li>
   <li><strong>Generic Repository</strong>: Implements common data access operations, abstracting the complexity of direct database interactions.</li>
   <li><strong>Generic Controller</strong>: Provides HTTP endpoints for CRUD operations, utilizing the generic repository for data handling.</li>
   <li><strong>Services</strong>: Includes additional services like AutoMapper for object mapping and identity services for user management.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>API security is implemented using an API key scheme for authentication. Ensure to protect your API keys and manage user permissions appropriately.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>SimpleApiTemplate offers a solid foundation for rapidly developing robust web applications with comprehensive CRUD functionality. By abstracting common tasks into generic components, it allows developers to focus on the unique aspects of their projects, enhancing productivity and code quality.</p>
